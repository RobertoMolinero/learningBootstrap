# Project Description

In this project I want to investigate, test and partly document as much as possible about web design. For this I use standard HTML and Twitter Bootstrap.

The goal is a catalog with sample solutions. This catalog will later serve as a template collection for myself.

Whoever finds something useful for himself here is welcome to help himself.
